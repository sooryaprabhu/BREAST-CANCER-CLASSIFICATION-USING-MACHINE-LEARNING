# Introduction

Breast cancer stands as one of the most prevalent cancers, impacting millions of women across the globe every year. The key to improving treatment efficacy and patient survival rates lies in the early detection of the disease. This project harnesses the capabilities of machine learning to significantly enhance the early detection process, providing a powerful tool for the classification of breast cancer tumors. Through the application of various machine learning algorithms, our objective is to accurately distinguish between malignant and benign tumors based on an extensive array of tumor characteristics. This endeavor not only demonstrates the potential of machine learning in medical diagnostics but also aims to contribute to the advancement of healthcare practices in oncology.

# Dataset

The utilized dataset comprises features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses, covering a wide range of attributes such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension of the cell nuclei.


# Implemented Models

üçÉLogistic Regression

üçÉSupport Vector Machine (SVM)

üçÉDecision Tree

üçÉRandom Forest


# Installation & Usage

Step 1: Install Python and Libraries

Make sure Python is installed on your computer. Then, install the required libraries by running this command in your terminal:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

Step 2: Clone the Repository


Clone this repo to your local machine using:

git clone https://github.com/sooryaprabhu/BREAST-CANCER-CLASSIFICATION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING/blob/main/%F0%9F%8D%81%20BREAST%20CANCER%20PREDICTION%20.ipynb


Step 3: Run the Project

üçÅOpen the project folder in your terminal.

üçÅLoad the 'breast cancer.csv' dataset.

üçÅRun the scripts for Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree,  and Random Forest models.

üçÅCheck the accuracy of each model to find the best one for classifying breast cancer tumors.


# Key Results

The project's findings highlight the effectiveness of Logistic Regression and Random Forest models, both achieving an accuracy of approximately 96.49% on the test data. Such results underscore the potential of machine learning models in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and supporting medical professionals in making informed decisions.
